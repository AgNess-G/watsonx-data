    "## Disclaimers\n",
    "- Use only Projects and Spaces that are available in watsonx context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "### Audience\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement advanced search techniques using a hybrid search approach combined with reranking strategies.\n",
    "The scenario presented in this notebook assumes you have a dataset requiring effective search capabilities, where a combination of traditional search (e.g., keyword-based) and modern embedding-based techniques is leveraged to improve retrieval quality. The reranking process further enhances the relevance of results by applying a secondary scoring mechanism to the initial search output.\n",
    "This notebook is designed for people interested in building or improving search systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some familiarity with Python programming, search algorithms, and basic machine learning concepts is recommended. The code runs with Python 3.10 or later.\n",
    "### Learning goal\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates similarity search support in watsonx.data using hybrid approach using dense embeddings and sparse embeddings, introducing commands for:\n",
    "- Connecting to Milvus\n",
    "- Creating collections\n",
    "- Creating indexes\n",
    "- Generate Dense Embeddings\n",
    "- Generate Sparse Embeddings\n",
    "- Ingesting data\n",
    "- Data retrieval\n",

    "### About Milvus \n",
    "\n",
    "Milvus is an open-source vector database designed specifically for scalable similarity search and AI applications. It's a powerful platform that enables efficient storage, indexing, and retrieval of vector embeddings, which are crucial in modern machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks.[ To know more, visit Milvus Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watsonxdata/2.1.x?topic=components-milvus)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Milvus: Three Fundamental Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "Collect and convert your data into high-dimensional vector embeddings. These vectors are typically generated using machine learning models like neural networks, which transform text, images, audio, or other data types into dense numerical representations that capture semantic meaning and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Vector Insertion\n",
    "Load the dense vector embeddings and sparse vector embeddings into Milvus collections or partitions within a database. Milvus creates indexes to optimize subsequent search operations, supporting various indexing algorithms like IVF-FLAT, HNSW, etc., based on the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Similarity Search\n",
    "Perform vector similarity searches by providing a query vector and a reranking weight. Milvus will rapidly return the most similar vectors from the collection or partitions based on the defined metrics like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or inner product and the reranking weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Hybrid search?\n",
    "Hybrid vector search leverages the combined strengths of sparse and dense vectors to deliver more accurate and relevant results. Dense vectors excel at capturing the deep semantic meaning of data, enabling better understanding and context-aware retrieval. Sparse vectors, on the other hand, are effective for capturing specific features or exact matches, such as keyword occurrences. By integrating both semantic context and feature matching, hybrid search ensures an approach that outperforms using than either method alone, making it particularly powerful for real-world search scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition** (once)\n",
    "2. **Ingestion** (once)\n",
    "3. **Retrieve relevant passage(s)** (for every user query)\n",
